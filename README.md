The Process of this Project is as follows:
I create a new GitHub repo with the name Datafun-05-sql.  It includes the default README.md and a .gitignore for Python. 
I cloned it down to my machine in my Documents folder.
I Use venv to create a new .venv environment in the repo on your machine. 
Activate your environment using the command for your operating system. 
I installed pandas.
I Installed pandas in.venv
I ran pip freeze and redirect the results (>) into requirements.txt 
I edited my.gitignore to ensure that .venv will not be pushed to GitHub.
I edited my README.md to show you the setup process. I also used Markdown for My title, section heading, and triple backtics for code. 
To finish I run Git add / commit / push to GitHub. I will have a clickable link to my repo for verification.
